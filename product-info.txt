AIML MODEL FOR CAR DAMAGE DETECTION FOR MOTOR CLAIMS SOLUTIONS-

1.	The files for running the product for damage detcetion are stored in the folder "damaged_cars" located at  "C:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\Desktop\damaged_cars"
2.	There are 3 html static pages saved inside a folder called templates. 
3.	The model weights for identifying if the image is car, if the car is damaged, detecting the location and severity of damage are stored in the folder called "h5_files".
	The weights obtained after training the custom tensorflow model for bounding boxes around the  damaged area are stored in the folder called "pb_files".
4. 	The file "product.py" has the final model for the damage detcetion and "damagearea_bbox.py" has the final object
	detection model. 
5.	The "app.py" file has flask code that is used to integrate the web pages with ML model. 
6.	The GET & POST responses are successfully tested using "Postman"
7.	Dockerfile is created to create an image and then export the container to run the application 
	on Asure. 
8. 	damagearea_bbox.py , product.py and app.py are the files needed to run the application 
9.	Folder file_input saves the image entered by the user. Folder area-bbox-test saves the 
	image after bounding box has been drawn around the damaged area.
10.	requirements.txt contains all the libraries needed for the product to run smoothly.
11.	Folder object_detection is needed for the bounding box prediction program. 


After cloning or downloading the repository to the laptop, run "app.py" file for the product to run.
